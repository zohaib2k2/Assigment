                The Mausoleum building was designed by famous architect Yahya Merchant.
                The design of the Mazar-e-Quaid was influenced by the Samanid Mausoleum in Bukhara, Uzbekistan. It is made of white marble with curved Moorish arches and copper grills reset on an elevated 54-square-meter platform.
                In the interior of the grave complex, there are three graves in a row and one to the north. The northern one, which is decorated with a series of black floral design at the base, belongs to Miss Fatima Jinnah, Quaid-e-Azam's sister.
