        The Atwood machine (or Atwood's machine) was invented in 1784 by the
        English mathematician George Atwood as a laboratory experiment to verify the mechanical laws
        of motion with constant acceleration.
         Atwood's machine is a common classroom demonstration used to illustrate principles of classical mechanics.
        The ideal Atwood machine consists of two objects of mass m1 and m2, connected by an inextensible massless string over an ideal massless pulley
