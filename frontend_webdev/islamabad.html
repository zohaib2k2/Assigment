                Creating beauty and preserving cultural heritage are goals for any assiduous urban planner,
                 and few capitals around the globe can kill two birds with one stone,
                 juxtaposing the old and the new with spectacular neck-craning wonders.
                 Pakistan’s capital city of Islamabad however has some legitimate swagger
                  to boast about. Stunning pyramidal mosques share the green cityscape, dotted with relaxing and family-friendly parks, rustic ruins, and avant-garde markets for the youthful hip crowd. Its no wonder that Pakistan’s pride gets on the podium for being the 2nd most beautiful city in the world, an often overlooked prestige that many people are oblivious to.

                    ed with four towering spires on each corner, the sacred temple stands as an illuminated beacon from any vantage point across the city.

                    Accommodating nearly a quarter million people to worship, the modern-looking wonder is situated at the foundation of the Margalla hills.
                    Intricately carved mosaics of marble and glass in triangular patterns hang from the tented ceiling in the prayer room which itself can hold over 10,000 people. Adjacent to the prayer room is the primary lecture hall as well as a library, restaurant and a cafe.

Meaning “foot hills” in ancient Persian language, Daman-e-Koh is a spectacular vista point in the Margalla hills where one can get a panoramic view of Islamabad and the picturesque Faisal mosque on the horizon.
